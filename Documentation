Objective:
To advance the fields of security and threat detection by developing a robust system for face recognition and emotion detection


Results:
To demonstrate the model's capabilities, we applied it to a few sample images:

Sample Image 1: Predicted emotion - Sad.
Sample Image 2: Predicted emotion - Fear.
Sample Image 3: Predicted emotion - Disgust.
Sample Image 4: Predicted emotion - Happy.
Sample Image 5: Predicted emotion - Surprise.

These predictions were visualized using Matplotlib, displaying the original images alongside the model's predictions. 
The model showed high accuracy in recognizing various emotions, illustrating its effectiveness for face recognition and emotion detection tasks.


Conclusion:
The successful application of our model to these test images highlights its potential for real-world use cases,
such as enhancing security systems and improving human-computer interaction through emotion-aware applications.
